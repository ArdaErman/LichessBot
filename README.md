# LichessBot
Here are the files to connect to lichess with a bot account. With polyglot option, you can download .bin books and .exe engines, put them into Engines folder and the bot is ready then. Config.yml file is important if you want to make the bot faster, you can even limit the book move options and much more on this file.
